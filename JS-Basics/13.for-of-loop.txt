The For Of Loop:

The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.

=> In iterable objects the order is important
=> for of loop executes in iterable objects(order mantain) like Arrays, Strings
=> for of loop does NOT work on an object directly.
=> for in loop executes in normal JS objects
