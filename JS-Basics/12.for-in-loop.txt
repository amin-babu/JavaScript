For in loop Syntax:

const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

for(let x in person){
  console.log(x,':',person[x]);
};

=> for in loop does not maintain the order
=> for in loop should be used in Objects
=> for in loop should not be used in Arrays if the index order is important
=> But only for loop can be used in an Array



Difference for of & in:
-----------------------

=> for of loop executes in iterable objects(order mantain) like Arrays, Strings
=> for in loop executes in normal JS objects
