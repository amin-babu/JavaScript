=> In JavaScript typeof is a operator like +,-. It is not a keyword or variable

Checking Function of any Data:
------------------------------

function isArray(myArray){
  console.log(myArray.constructor.toString().indexOf('Array') > -1);
};

isArray([1, 2, 3]);

=> undefined -> undefined means variable declared but did not assign any value. value did not assign thats why it is a default value and undefined is also a data type

=> "" empty -> Empty means its a blank and string data type

=> null -> In JS null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
