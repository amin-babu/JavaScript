Array Iteration:
----------------

1. forEach() => The forEach() method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.

2. map() => The map() method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element.

3. filter() => The filter() method creates a new array based on True condition

4. reduce() => It shows only one value, the total's value is array's first element if the value don't set.

5. reduceRight() => It same as reduce, just work from right side

6. every() => If one condition is false, it will show false. To be true, every condition will have to be true.

6. some() => If one condition is true, it will show true. To be false, every condition will have to be false.

7. indexOf() => This mothod works for checking the position of the element and shows the index  number of the element.

8. includes() => it checks any element is available or not.

9. find() => This method shows only one number based  on condition. it works from from left. if first element condition is false, it will go to the next one.





Best Example for practising:
----------------------------



//checking duplicate and uniques numbers

const numbers = [1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 8, 12, 13, 19];

const duplicates = numbers.filter(function(value, index, array){
  return array.indexOf(value) !== index
  //return array.indexOf(value) === index
});
