Difference Between Regular Function and Arrow Function:
-------------------------------------------------------


1️⃣ Regular functions (function keyword):
this refers to the object where the function is called.
Works correctly inside objects.


2️⃣ Arrow functions (=> syntax):
DO NOT have their own this.
Inherit this from the surrounding (outer) scope, which is usually global (or the parent function).

💡 "Regular functions take this from the calling object, but arrow functions take this from where they were created."

👉 Regular function? → this works from the object.
👉 Arrow function? → this comes from outside the object.



✅ Use Regular Functions When:
✔ You need this to refer to the object (e.g., object methods).
✔ You need to access the arguments object.
✔ You need to use the function as a constructor with new.

✅ Use Arrow Functions When:
✔ You want to inherit this from the surrounding scope (e.g., inside a setTimeout).
✔ You want shorter, cleaner syntax (especially for one-liner functions).
✔ You don’t need an arguments object.



Key Difference Recap:
Regular function: this depends on how the function is called (object or global).
Arrow function: this is inherited from where the function is defined, which is usually the global scope
